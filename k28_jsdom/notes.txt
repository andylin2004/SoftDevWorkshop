K28 -- Getting more comfortable with the dev console and the DOM
2022-02-08

Turns out, its very hard to manipulate the page from the body of the page (unless you have a id assigned to that)
You can dig through the DOM with getElementsByTagName or getElementById on document (which are indexable if you want to remove something)
You can use classList.add() to add the class of a item, but only if there wasn't one before
you can remove elements with .remove(), and add with .appendChild (on a indexable thing like lists)
.createElement allows you to create a html element of type specified in param, but this is not committed until appendchild is use
you can OOP and prefill things in? why would you want to do this?
you can use .toString just like in java to convert int to strings
