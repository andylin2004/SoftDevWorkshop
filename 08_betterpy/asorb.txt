Questions: What does pandas do? (an external library that can help with reading csv files, according to Jonathan)


Comments: I'm surprised that using external libraries are allowed in the K06 assignment--I thought that it was illegal. Also pulling the data from a web address to a python script is an intresting idea--although I would personally not want to try this because I'd rather make there are less layers to failure.

Concerns: N/A, I feel very good about this.
