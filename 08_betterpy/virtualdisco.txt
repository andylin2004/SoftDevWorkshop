The python3 -m venv ~/myherozero command will make a new Python virtual enviroment that is called myherozero in your HOME directory such that you can install a set of packages that might be on an older version and not have it collide with a newer version of a package that is installed globally. This way, you can run legacy packages that a script may be dependent on and is costoly to rebuild for a newer version of the Python file.
