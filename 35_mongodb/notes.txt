document: way to organize and store data as key value pair
collection: organized store of documents, with common keys between the documents
atlas: database in cloud for mongodb coursework, database as a service, for data storage and retrieval
cluster: groups of servers that can be used to store data
replica set: conneced mongodb instances storing same data (redundancy purposes)
instance: single machine (locally or cloud) running some software
atlas by default configs mongodb databases as a replica set

things atlas can do:
    manage cluster making
    run + maintain db deployment
    use cloud service provider of your choice
    mess around with new things
    multiple tiers of atlas w different configs and prices
    (free tier has 3 server replica set, 512mb storage, doesnt expire, can use charts and realm, good for small-scale apps)
