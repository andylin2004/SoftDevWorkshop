K14 -- notes for assignment where website to push out form inputs to another website
2021-10-14

<form action="/auth">: whenever the form is submitted, the first string appended to the URL is /auth
      <input type="text" name="username">: the second string appended to the URL is text with the username given
      <input type="submit" name="sub1">: this is sort of special because this is a button rendered by HTML. This is the third string appended to the URL: submit with sub1
</form> 
By default, the request type is a GET request for pulling website data. We think sending data is a POST request. Request and app seems to be predefined in flask (because we think it is initalized as blank and values are assigned later on).
In order to do a POST request, the form tag needs to include method=“POST” and the route decorator should include POST in the methods array.

GET requests occur when user attempts to refresh a page. POST requests occur when a user loads in a page from the login screen (so basically submitting data to another page).
urandom(int x) makes a random string of x length.
session is a dictionary that is built in python. you can add a dictionary value to add a new session, then remove it when the user logs out.
in keyword is used for checking to see if a dictionary key is in a dictionary.
