divs--very helpful in order to group out some html elements so you can apply a css effect on all child html of divs

styles inline--just use style param (eg style="whatever style here")

style formatting:

category: setting; (the ; is very important)

font-family dictates the type of font to use (eg sans-serif)

set website background color by setting background color in the html tag
set child background color by setting background color in the body tag
you can use a hex color code for the colors
flex allows you to have two website elements side by side, provided they are grouped in a div with style display:flex and the child elements has flex (eg flex:1) with how many portions on the display (part/whole)
headers by default have a margin

you can have a class name for a html element by using class="classname"

style sheet syntax:

element type (or class name when using . in front of class name){
    styles here;
}

internal style sheet - enclose css in <style> tags

external style sheet - use <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="stylesheet file">, the internal stylesheet style can be copypastaed into the stylesheet file
