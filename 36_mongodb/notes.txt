how does mongodb store data:
data stored in json

json:
start and end w curly braces
seperate each key and value with colon
seperate each pair with comma
keys (or fields in mongodb) in quotes
can nest documents in mongodb
good for when you need to export to a local machine to read it

pros of json:
friendly, readable, familiar

cons of json:
text based, space consuming, limited data type support

bson:
binary json
compresses json data down to try and fix space consuming issue
good for speed, space, and flexibility
general purpose focus
mongodb stores data in this format
json still be stored and retrieved in mongodb
good for cases when it needs to be backed up to the cloud or exported to a diff system

bson cmds:
mongodump --uri "<cluster uri>" dumps data
mongoexport --uri "<cluster uri>" --collection=<collection name> --out=<filename>.json
