DISCO
Interesting that the website ends up using the system font (website font looks like the default one on Apple devices)
There is an alert class that can be combined with a type of alert (such as alert-danger) as a class in order to make a good alert notification
Tables look very fancy in bootstrap
table is a html tag that contains table elements
thead is a html tag that contains the first row of the table 
tbody is a html tag that contains the rest of the table
tr is used to make a new table row
th is used to add a table element text that is bolded
td is used to add a normal table element
you can style a table with table and table-striped classes in bootstrap in order to make a table have a striped appearance

Q0 (Did you have to consult resources beyond your Devo-generated on-ramp? If so, cite all – including verbal consultations.)
No.
Q1 (only to be answered after you have finished… At this point, which front-end framework do you prefer, and why?)
For development, I prefer Foundation because of how it feels less verbose--you don't have to repeat the overlying class name for applying a class subset to a html element (eg for list-group with the flush style, you have to repeat list-group then - then flush in order to apply the flush style, which is annoying). However, from a looks standpoint, I prefer Bootstrap, as I find that the UI elements tend to be more rounded, which reflects the current design trends as seen on macOS and Windows.
