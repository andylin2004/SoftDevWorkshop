more data explorer: atlas
in the index tab, you view indexes in collections, make new indexes, and drop them
can also allow you to see how useful an index is so that you can drop the less used ones
schema anti-patterns tabs will advise you on what you should do to your data model
aggregation tab allows you to build aggregation pipelines in a gui view and see how different ways to use it affect databases
    can drag and drop stages of the pipelines
    like vscode, but more interactive
    can export the aggregation pipeline once you polished it enough
atlas search: finer indexing for advanced indexing

atlas features:
organization: group projects, teams, billing (although you dont need to stress if you're in the free tier)
projects: shows all projects, can configure access and alerts
each project can have multiple atlas clusters, as long as each cluster has an unique name
can also access realm and charts
realm allows users to create web, mobile, or other apps without worrying about managing or scaling servers, but can still easily track data once needed
there are docs for each mongodb services

charts: 
allows users to make dynamic data visualizations and use it anywhere
can connect to many databases, can use many different data visualizations
can make aggregation pipelines out of charts

compass:
gui tool to connect to mongodb database
NEVER EVER TOUCH THE ADMIN CONFIG OR LOCAL DATABASES OR THINGS WILL BLOW UP (unless support asks you to mess with it)
you can see size of database, num of collections and indexes
allows you to have the atlas ui locally, plus see things as a table
on compass, you can run schema locally
can manually make a index in compass and throw in options as needed

more mongodb compass:
explain plan will be able to show the documents that fall under a certain query
