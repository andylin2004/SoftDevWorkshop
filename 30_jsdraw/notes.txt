when drawing images always start with ctx.beginpath() to tell the program to prepare to draw
fill() will fill the previously manipulated shape with a previously specified color (defaults to black)
arc will make a curve that can ultimately create a circle (takes in centerX, centerY, radius, startAngle, endAngle)
clearrect(x,y,width,height) will clear the rectangle that was specified to the default color
you can actually pass variables into a function initally specified in a event listener
fillrect will make a filled in rectangle at x,y with size width,height
e.offsetX and e.offsetY will show the mouse location relative to the element you are manipulating
ctx can be made with c.getElement("2d") (or 3d if you feel like so)
