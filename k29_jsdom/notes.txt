K29 -- Using JS with DOM to change the properties of a html element
2022-02-09

HTML buttons can live independently of a form
When working with JS, always ID tag your elements that will be needed to be used by JS
In JS, a HTML element has the addEventListener(event: String, function: function) function, which will allow you to make the button fire a function when a specified interaction with the element is done (eg a click event). 
No imports needed to use Math functions such as random and round can be used without importing
JS tends to be vague when bugs occur in terms of what params I may had messed up on
Is there a way to mandate that a param is of a certain type (like in Python)?
